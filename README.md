# flutter_recipe_app

This was just a simple recipe app made in flutter. Nothing extraordinary. There are a couple of recipes that the user can tap on and they will take the user to another page/screen that will show an enlarged image of the food in the recipe with the ingredients.

This current project was from the Flutter Apprentice book. I highly recommend buying and reading it! The book includes many projects and teaches you flutter pretty well.
